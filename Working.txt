# This project is to convert a currency to another currency
# It takes 1 as a coin.
# E.g., USD to INR - (85.1 INR) somthing

# Appraoch

1. We are using (Jsoup) which is a package which will help us to freely scrap the data from a site. 
Like a google crawler does.

2. We will work with every currency by govt. in this world. And User needs to input currency codes.

3. - > Take inputs from user (1 = currency want to convert) and (2 = currency wants to covert in).

4. - > Validate both inputs (maintain an array of all currency codes and check it has match if not then return false).

5. - > Use Jsoup and embbed the both inputs in url. and make a url.

6. - > Use Jsoup's fuction .connect('url').get() with this w'll get the site access.

7. - > Using .select('classname') of Element class we will make an list of all select match elements

8. - > And we will iterate over Element and then get actuual current conversion rate.

9. - > Then we will print that for the user.

10. - >  open cmd and change directory to the same location where RunThis.java file is.
And then run these two commads:
// 1: (javac -cp ".;jsoup-1.19.1.jar" RunThis.java)
// 2: (java -cp ".;jsoup-1.19.1.jar" RunThis)
